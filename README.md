# Notes to self

1. All the configs are stored in a `~/.config` folder for convenience
2. I've explicitly chosen not to follow [Conventional Commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), as they would be an overkill for a small personal repo like this. Instead I'm using [Hexlet recommendations](https://ru.hexlet.io/blog/posts/git-commit-message) (to also make my brain work a little and experiment with another approach to writing commits)
3. It's best to listen to the Shrek soundtrack or jazz while setting up the macOS environment for the sake of your sanity when something suddenly crashes
